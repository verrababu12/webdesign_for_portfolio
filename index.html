      <h1>Web Design</h1>
      <p>
        My web design philosophy revolves around creating beautiful,
        user-centric websites that not only look stunning but also offer a
        seamless browsing experience. I believe that a well-designed website
        should be intuitive, engaging, and tailored to meet the needs of the
        target audience.
      </p>

      <h2>My Design Process</h2>
      <p>
        I follow a structured design process that ensures every website I create
        is unique and serves its purpose effectively:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>Research & Planning:</strong> Understanding the client’s
          needs, target audience, and competitors to create a strategic plan.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Wireframing & Prototyping:</strong> Creating wireframes and
          prototypes to visualize the website layout and structure.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Visual Design:</strong> Developing the website's visual
          elements, including color schemes, typography, and imagery.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Development:</strong> Translating the design into a fully
          functional website using clean, responsive code.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Testing & Launch:</strong> Rigorous testing to ensure the site
          functions perfectly before its official launch.
        </li>
      </ol>
